Freshwater Ecology

Students will use research techniques developed by aquatic science specialists and teachers from The _Stroud Water Research Center_ and _LaMotte. _Students will collect and study freshwater macro-invertebrates in their natural aquatic habitats. Students will learn about the complex relationship between the health of streamside forests and stream life. Learn how natural balances are maintained in streams, along with food chain relationships and pollution impacts. Students will learn water quality monitoring techniques that include seven key water quality tests, including pH, nitrate-nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, total alkalinity, turbidity, and temperature.
