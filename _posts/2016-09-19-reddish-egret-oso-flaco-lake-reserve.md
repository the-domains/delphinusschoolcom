  of the green vegetable zone. This lake is on the border between San Luis
  Obispo and Santa Barbara counties. Its an amazing site that attracts birders,

  surf scoters, snowey egrets, swallows, great blue herons, and peregrine
  falcons among other species, either live here or visit for the summer.
