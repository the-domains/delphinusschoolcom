  Students will explore geological formations, such as the sand dunes and bluffs
  trails of Montana de Oro, and Valencia Peak. Students will learn how forces
  within the Earth initiate the events that cause volcanic eruptions and
  earthquakes, and how those events have shaped Californiaâ€™s coastline and
  coastal mountain ranges. Students will also search for marine artifacts among
  the uplifted marine terraces of Montana de Oro. Students will learn to
  distinguish between sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks, and learn the
  processes involved in converting rocks from one type to another.

### Coastal Geology
![The talus caves of this 26 million year-old volcanic formation are on the the Pacific Plate side of the San Andreas Fault. The other one-third of this formation; the Nenach Formation sits on the North American Plate nearly 200 miles south near Lancaster, Calif.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1a707a21-4858-493d-9c62-679d03e6532a.jpg)
