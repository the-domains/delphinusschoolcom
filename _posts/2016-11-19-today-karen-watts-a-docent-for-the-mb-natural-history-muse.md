  Today, Karen Watts, a docent for the MB Natural History Museum, led an
  absolutely amazing workshop for our students. Students learned to identify
  various types of phytoplankton (phyto=plant; planktos=drifter) and
  (zoo=animal) plankton. Students also learned to identify Pseudo nitzschia, the
  phytoplankton which produces the toxin domoic acid. Domoic acid causes clams,
  mussels, oysters, sardines, anchovies and dungeness crabs to become toxic.
  Domoic acid poisoning also causes severe pathologies among marine mammals that
  prey on these species. Domoic acid poisoning impacts California sea lions in
  particular, because anchovies and sardines are a major component of the
  dietary intake. These two "fat rich" fish are an essential part of their diet.
  These fish are necessary for lactating females who need to produce "fat rich"
  milk for their pups. Sea otters, consume lots of clams, oysters, mussels,
  (filter feeders) which are not themselves affected by the plankton they feed
  on. Its a classic example of what scientist call "bio-accumulation"; the
  toxicity increases as the toxin works its way up the marine trophic levels.
