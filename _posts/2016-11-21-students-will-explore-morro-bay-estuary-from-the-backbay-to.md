  Students will explore Morro Bay Estuary from the backbay to the harbor mouth.
  While learning the importance of estuaries, in sustaining marine life in the
  open ocean. We’ll observe the nesting and parental behavior of local marine
  birds, and the feeding behavior summer migrants, like Caspian terns, and White
  Pelicans. We’ll also keep an eye out for predatory birds like falcons, hawks,
  and osprey that patrol the estuary’s salt marsh, dunes, and its shorelines.
  “Belly Biology” on the docks, is a hands-on activity where students “lay on
  their bellies” to see and touch marine invertebrates like barnacles, sponge,
  anemones and mussels attached to the dock’s sides. We’ll also search through
  giant kelp to look for nudibranchs and other kelp dwelling animals.We’ll
  explore the salt marsh and mudflats, to examine the Morro Bay watershed, and
  see the effects of the constant transport of inland soils on the southern end
  of the bay. Much of our exploration will be from kayaks, allowing us to
  observe marine life at water level. We’ll visit an oyster farm, and explore
  the sand spit dunes and beaches which offers miles of open shoreline for
  wandering, and scavenger hunts. Well observe the effects of tide cycles  on
  life in the estuary, learn to read tide charts. We’ll finish the week by
  boarding a Sub-Sea charter boat for a whale watching cruise to track
  humpbacks, blue whales, and dolphins!
