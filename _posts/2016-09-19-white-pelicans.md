  White pelicans are one of the largest birds in North America, 2nd only to the
  California condor.  They are found on inland lakes, but migrate to the coast
  during the summer.  Unlike brown pelicans, these birds don't dive but rather
  herd fish from the surface of the water in pairs or groups, then dipping their
  beaks to scoop them up.
